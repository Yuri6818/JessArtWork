        <p style="text-align: center;">Please read these terms carefully before commissioning work. By purchasing a commission, you agree to these terms.</p>

        <h3>NFT & Cryptocurrency Policy</h3>
        <p>I do not sell any of my art as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), traffic in cryptocurrency, or participate in any blockchain-related activity. Under no circumstance may I or my art be used, minted, or sold in this manner. This includes any commissioned work—my creative copyright allows me to prohibit any for-profit use, including sale as an NFT.</p>
        
        <h3>Commission Process</h3>
        <p><strong>1. Initial Contact:</strong> To begin, contact me with your commission request, including character references and a description of your idea. We will discuss the details and I will provide a price quote.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Sketch & Approval:</strong> Once payment is made, I will create a preliminary sketch for your review. You may request major changes at this stage. Up to 3 rounds of minor revisions are included.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Final Artwork:</strong> After the sketch is approved, I will proceed with lining and coloring the artwork. Only minor color adjustments can be made at this stage. Turnaround time is typically 1-2 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Usage Rights</h3>
        <p>Personal use is permitted for all commissioned work. You may post the artwork on your social media (with credit), use it as a profile picture, etc. Commercial use requires a separate licensing agreement and fee. You may not resell, redistribute, or claim my artwork as your own creation.</p>
        
        <h3>Payment & Refunds</h3>
        <p>Payment is required upfront for all work via PayPal. Refunds are available before work begins (minus any transaction fees). Once work has started, refunds are provided on a case-by-case basis depending on the amount of work completed.</p>

        <h3>Artist Rights</h3>
        <p>I, the artist, retain the copyright to the artwork and the right to display it in my portfolio, on social media, and for promotional purposes. I reserve the right to refuse any commission request for any reason. The client will not be charged if the commission is refused.</p>
