This is a compact digital art portfolio made with basic HTML/CSS/JS.

Background image instructions
- Place your desired background image (e.g. the attached rose-forest image) into the `images/` folder and name the file `background.jpg`.
- The stylesheet (`style.css`) is already set to load `images/background.jpg` as a full-page background with a subtle dark overlay for readability.

If you want to use a different filename, open `style.css` and change the URL at the top of the file:

```css
body { background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(10,12,15,0.35), rgba(10,12,15,0.35)), url('images/background.jpg'); }
```

Testing locally
- Open `index.html` in a browser (or run a quick local static server) to preview the site with the chosen background.

If you'd like, I can add the attached image into the repo for you — tell me the filename you'd like to use (or allow me to pick `images/background.jpg`) and I'll add it in.
